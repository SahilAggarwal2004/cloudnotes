# CloudNotes - Notes on Cloud

CloudNotes is a web application designed for quick and convenient note-taking. It lets you access and manage your notes seamlessly, whether you are online or offline. With its offline-first design, you can create, edit, and view your notes entirely offline, and new notes are automatically synchronized to the cloud when you reconnect to the internet. CloudNotes keeps your notes private and secure, making it a reliable platform for managing your notes efficiently.

This project was inspired by a React tutorial, with many additional features added to enhance functionality and usability.
